"""
Defines the ROSDataloader object that subscribes to pose and images topics,
and populates an image tensor and Cameras object with values from these topics.
Image and pose pairs are added at a prescribed frequency and intermediary images
are discarded (could be used for evaluation down the line).

    Creates batches of the dataset return type. In this case of nerfstudio this means
    that we are returning batches of full images, which then are sampled using a
    PixelSampler. For this class the image batches are progressively growing as
    more images are recieved from ROS, and stored in a pytorch tensor.

    Args:
        dataset: Dataset to sample from.
        publish_posearray: publish a PoseArray to a ROS topic that tracks the poses of the
            images that have been added to the training set.
        data_update_freq: Frequency (wall clock) that images are added to the training
            data tensors. If this value is less than the frequency of the topics to which
            this dataloader subscribes (pose and images) then this subsamples the ROS data.
            Otherwise, if the value is larger than the ROS topic rates then every pair of
            messages is added to the training bag.
        device: Device to perform computation.
